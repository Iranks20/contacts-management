# UX Canvas Generated Project

This React + TypeScript + Vite project was generated by UX Canvas AI Designer.

## Vite Template

This template uses Vite for fast development and building.

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Building

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── screens/        # Application screens/pages
├── App.tsx         # Main application component
└── main.tsx        # Application entry point
```

## How It Works

- **Screens**: Navigate between screens using kebab-case paths in the URL
- **Components**: Reusable UI components used throughout the application

## Screen Navigation

Navigate between screens using kebab-case paths:
- `http://localhost:5173/home-page`
- `http://localhost:5173/profile-page`
- `http://localhost:5173/` (shows screen list when no screen specified)

Legacy query parameter format (`?screen=ScreenName`) is also supported for backward compatibility.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
